# 230: The Roman staging into the canonical data - the 211 consolidation re-run
Depends on: 211, 207a, 207b, 207c
Touches: fit/merge.py, data/catalog/extras.jsonl, data/commons/files.jsonl, data/commons/classified.jsonl, data/merge/, data/books/index.jsonl, data/books/validation.json, data/sites/, docs/sources.md, web/data/sites.json, web/data/sites/, web/data/plans.json, tests/test_merge.py

## Goal
211's lead note: the 211 consolidation ran without the Roman books (207 was stopped by
the owner at merge time) and "207a/207b staging, if it ever resumes, goes through a
later re-run of this step." This task is that re-run. Once 211 is done and the Roman
staging (extras_roman.jsonl / files_roman.jsonl / classified_roman.jsonl plus the three
books' per-book lists/triage artifacts) has landed on main, re-run the consolidation:
fold the Roman rows into data/catalog/extras.jsonl, data/commons/files.jsonl and
classified.jsonl; rebuild data/books/index.jsonl and validation.json from ALL books'
per-book artifacts (including the three Roman books) with the existing machinery;
update the Roman row of docs/sources.md section 9; build any new Roman sites (207c's
are mostly new no-QID Scottish forts) and refresh web/data/sites.json and
web/data/plans.json. The page renders the result with no page change (GOAL.md point 5).

If a 207 subtask is dropped before this task runs, edit the Depends on line to the
surviving subtasks and run against the staging that exists (the boxes hold with the
books that landed).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The fit/merge.py re-run: every Roman staging row is in the canonical files; every
      pre-run canonical row is still byte-identical (pure growth); a second run changes
      nothing (idempotent); the run is logged in data/merge/log.jsonl (0 refused, or
      each refusal logged with its reason).
- [ ] data/books/index.jsonl is rebuilt from the per-book files of all books (the
      post-211 set plus the three Roman books); validation.json regenerated; every row
      that reaches the plan list carries the 200 evidence field; fit/evidence.py check
      passes offline on the merged set including the Roman rows.
- [ ] Every new Roman site id has web/data/sites/<id>/; web/data/sites.json grows by
      exactly the new sites and the pre-run entries are unchanged (except the 212-owned
      marker fields); web/data/plans.json: every pre-run (id, sites[0]) key still
      present, (id, sites[0]) still unique, the new Roman picture rows present
      (tools/export_plans.py re-run).
- [ ] docs/sources.md section 9: the Roman lead row records what was staged and what
      was dropped, per book, sourced from docs/lead_roman.md and the merge log
      (replacing the "NONE in this merge" row 211 wrote).
- [ ] The human's reference is untouched: the 25 hand fits and their 19 sites
      (tests/test_serve.py::test_hand_fits_are_the_reference) still pass after the
      re-run; the re-run's tests are hermetic (port 0, temp tree, no network).

## Notes
- Same invariants as 211: row conflicts (a Roman row equal to a canonical row or to a
  row staged by another source) resolve first-wins, recorded in data/merge/log.jsonl -
  never a silent rewrite.
- Building sites is the slow part (DEM fetch, images); it is a working-phase command.
  The test asserts the data-level result (entries, joins, idempotence) on the served
  data, not a full rebuild.
- When this task runs, tests/test_merge.py's frozen pre-merge baseline (the 385
  entries) shifts to the post-211 state (the 499 entries); update the baseline in the
  test for this intended change.
