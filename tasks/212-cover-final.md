# 212: Cover - the last uncovered sites, the final sync, the report
Depends on: 203a, 203b, 211
Touches: fit/cover.py, data/review/, web/data/review.json, data/commons/files.jsonl, data/commons/classified.jsonl, web/data/plans.json, web/data/sites.json, web/data/sites/, docs/batch.md, tests/test_cover.py

## Goal
The last pass of GOAL.md point 1 and its evidence for the human. For every built site
still without a fit (after the batch, 203a/203b, and the new pictures, 211): a targeted
picture search (the site's QID Commons category, P180 depictions, a title search) with the
search recorded; a found picture becomes a candidate through the normal loop (fitkit sheet ->
model fit -> fit -> gate); a site where nothing is found gets a review item marked "no picture found"
with exactly what was searched. Then the one and only page-facing sync: every fit
document (the 20 hand fits, the automatic ones, the human-saved ones) becomes its site's
overlay and its drawings count in web/data/sites.json, through the existing plan_fit
machinery; web/data/review.json becomes the current open list for the page's review
section (201). Finally docs/batch.md: the report the human reads - counts per outcome,
the seeded 20-sample of automatically accepted fits (a page URL each) for the 18/20
check, and the "no picture found" list.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] fit/cover.py runs the targeted search for every built site without a fit and without
      a candidate: the searches (categories, P180 queries, date) are recorded; a found
      picture is staged in the canonical files (files.jsonl + classified.jsonl, with the
      200 evidence field) and its row added to web/data/plans.json; the site goes through
      the normal loop (fitkit sheet -> model fit -> fit -> gate) and ends with an automatic document or a
      review item.
- [ ] A site with nothing found gets a review item marked "no picture found" with exactly
      what was searched (assumption 3 of PLAN.md); the human can drop the site or name a
      source from the item.
- [ ] The page-facing sync (the only task that runs it): every fit document produces its
      site's overlay (web/data/sites/<id>/depictions.json) and its drawings count in
      web/data/sites.json, through the existing plan_fit machinery; the 25 hand fits'
      overlays are unchanged (000's golden test still passes).
- [ ] web/data/review.json is the current open list for the page's review section:
      resolved items out, new items in; the served page shows the right count (checked
      through the page, not the file).
- [ ] docs/batch.md: the final report - counts per outcome (fit: hand / automatic /
      human-saved; review item; no picture found), the seeded 20-sample of automatically
      accepted fits (page URL each, fixed and reproducible from the recorded seed) for
      the human's 18/20 check, and the "no picture found" list with what was searched per
      site.
- [ ] Test (no network, port 0): after the sync, every built site in the served
      sites.json has drawings >= 1 or an open review item (GOAL.md point 1, in full); the
      25 hand fits are intact (the golden test); the sample in docs/batch.md is
      reproducible from the recorded seed.

## Notes
- This task runs last on purpose: it alone writes web/data/review.json, the per-site
  depictions and the drawings counts, so no other in-flight task can collide with it.
- The sync runs plan_fit.main() by hand (the way serve.py's after_write does it in
  production); the tests never start the server's platefits path for this - they check
  the served result.
- The 20-sample must stay a fixed record: the human's 18/20 check (GOAL.md point 3) is
  the project's acceptance, and a moving sample would make it unrepeatable.

## Hand-over

## Lead note (2026-10-12, after 211)
- The fit in this task's loop is the MATCHER, not a vision-model fit: tools/site_done.py already runs
  fit/matchfit.py first on every picture without a document whenever the matcher answers (ELoFTR on
  127.0.0.1:8091 is reachable from this VM; RoMa on 8092 is not, and site_done works without it).
  The vision-model batch fit invented its points (301) and must not place anything. An unsure matcher
  result goes to the review item, as site_done already does.
- 211's new pictures are in the canonical files but most have no local copy, so they are not in
  web/data/plans.json yet (still 1168 rows on main): `python pipeline/commons.py thumbs` fetches rows
  with a `thumb`; the Limes rows carry only a full-file `url` (upload.wikimedia.org) - fetch those too
  (the original, or a standard thumbnail width), then `tools/export_plans.py`. The lead did this on the
  owner's Mac (1168 -> 1296 rows, plus the Civitates/Merian full pages); data/raw is gitignored, so
  this checkout needs its own copies.
