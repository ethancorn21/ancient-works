# 217: Book machinery - town-view lists and the view-as-drawing index for Civitates/Merian
Depends on: 216
Touches: pipeline/books_lists.py

## Goal
GOAL.md point 5 (2026-10-10): artists' aerial and bird's-eye views count as drawings as much as
surveys. The machinery does not let them through: stage A types a perspective view
`other_illustration`, the list taxonomy's kind "o" means "other (views, sections alone, ...)", and
`cmd_index` emits an index row only for kind "s" (site plan) - so a book of town views (Civitates,
Merian) validates and triages but indexes to nothing. Add the per-book list transcriptions to
`books_lists` and the taxonomy/index change that carries a town-view plate through as a drawing.

Source material: task 213's hand transcription `data/books/lists/civitatesorbiste00brau.json` (its town
plates with inscriptions and printed pages - the single source of truth; lift it, do not re-transcribe
it by hand a second time) and `data/books/triage/civitatesorbiste00brau.F.jsonl` (per-figure captions).
Merian's `topographiahelve00zeil` list: transcribe from the book's own contents pages (its OCR is
cached in `data/raw/books/<ia>/`) once the civitates path works.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `books_lists` carries the civitates_liber2 town list; `books.py ocrmap civitates_liber2`
      regenerates `data/books/lists/civitatesorbiste00brau.json`[`.map.json`] from it (the file content
      stays 213's; the module mirrors it - one place for the knowledge, the file is the dump).
- [ ] The index emits one row per indexed town-view plate for the view books, and the row records that
      it is a VIEW (not a plan) - a field 211's merge and the page can branch on (the plan books' rows
      are unaffected in shape).
- [ ] `books.py validate` over the existing plan books gives the same results as before the change
      (their metrics must not drift - a view plate is not a site plan for their recall/precision).
