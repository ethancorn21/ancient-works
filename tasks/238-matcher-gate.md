# 238: Every matcher fit goes through the frozen 001 gate
Depends on: 302f, 302g
Touches: fit/matchfit.py, tests/test_matchfit_gate.py, docs/gate.md

## Goal
GOAL point 3 (2026-10-13): "Every matcher fit goes to the gate (point 3)." Today
`fit/matchfit.run` writes a platefit document the moment its own `judge()` is silent, and the
document's "score" is the raw median matcher residual — the frozen 001 gate
(`pipeline/fit_gate.py`, `docs/gate.md` section 2) has never been run on the 49 matcher fits.
This task puts the gate between the judge and the write: a matcher fit is accepted by numbers,
never by the matcher's opinion. The gate is applied exactly as frozen (section 1 forbids
re-tuning; this task adds no threshold, no clause, no exception for the matcher's point style).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `fit/matchfit.run`: after `judge()` is silent, the document's pairs (the up-to-8
      spread-selected inliers) go through `pipeline/fit_gate.gate` with `transform=None` (the
      gate solves the canonical similarity, as it does when no placement is claimed); the
      document is written only when the verdict is ACCEPT, and its "score" is the gate's
      median residual in ground metres (the batch's own convention, `batch_us.gate_placement`)
      — the raw matcher residual stays in the matcher block for the record.
- [ ] A gate refusal writes no document: the per-candidate result the run reports carries the
      gate's `why` clause verbatim (e.g. "median residual 62 m > 45 m"), the printed line names
      it, and the line's review-item upsert records that reason for the candidate (239
      consumes this result; until then the existing upsert path already records whatever the
      matcher did not place).
- [ ] `docs/gate.md` gains one APPENDED section: the matcher's fit as a gate input (pairs = up
      to 8 spread-selected matcher inliers; no claimed placement — the gate solves the
      canonical similarity, as it does when none is given), the frozen rule applied unchanged,
      and how the two refusal stages divide the failures (the judge: weak or near-line
      consensus; the gate: large median residual, radial gradient — the registered 15% scale
      miss, section 9, is the class only the gate catches). No threshold or rule change
      anywhere else in the file.
- [ ] `tests/test_matchfit_gate.py` (new file; no network: the matcher's `/match` answers come
      from recorded fixtures behind the ephemeral-port stub idiom of `tests/conftest.py`;
      `fit_gate` itself is numpy-only): one candidate that passes the judge but fails a gate
      clause produces no document and the refusal reason; one candidate that passes both
      produces a document whose score is the gate's median; and the 22 golden hand-fit
      documents and all 49 existing matcher documents in the real checkout are byte-unchanged
      after the test.
- [ ] The suite has no new reds against the newest driver loop-start note in PROGRESS.md.

## Notes
- `pipeline/fit_gate.py`: `gate(pairs, transform=None) -> (verdict, stats {n, med, slope_o,
  io})` in ground metres. The batch's adapter `batch_us.gate_placement(pairs, (a, b))` shows
  the existing call shape (its `(a, b)` is the placement the model claimed; the matcher passes
  None).
- The matcher's RANSAC refit (`matchfit.ransac`) is a least squares over its inliers, so the
  gate's canonical solve over the selected up-to-8 pairs is the same placement up to the
  selection's noise — a good fit stays good through the gate.
- The recorded badbury ELoFTR candidate (22 inliers, 3.62 deg, 2.9 m centre;
  `data/matchfit/heldout/results.json`, the 302f fixture source) is the natural passes-both
  example; a 15%-scale-wrong variant of a recorded answer (build it by scaling the ground
  points, label it synthetic) is the natural passes-judge / fails-gate example.
