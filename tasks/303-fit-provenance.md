# 303: Every fit says who placed it - no agent fit passes as a hand fit
Depends on: none
Touches: data/db/platefits/, pipeline/plan_fit.py, tools/site_done.py, tests/test_fit_provenance.py, docs/site_flow.md

## Goal
The line's fabrication check (301) looks only at documents marked `"auto": true`; a document without the mark is
treated as the owner's hand fit and goes straight to the map. 206 wrote
data/db/platefits/shotwick-castle-q7502621.c_e6e5490609414bb9.json with 4 pairs placed by an agent session
(round page pixels: 405,25 / 827,570 / 620,835 ...) and no mark. The owner's hand fits are listed in
tests/golden/hand_fit_docs.sha256 (20), plus Maiden Castle's DPLA plan placed on the Mac page 2026-10-11 (main cd104ca).

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every platefit document carries who placed it: `"by": "hand"` (the page's save, the owner) or `"by": "agent"`
      (anything a script or a session wrote). The page's save path (server/serve.py -> plan_fit) writes "hand"; every
      agent/script path writes "agent". Existing documents: the 21 hand fits get "hand"; every other one gets "agent".
- [ ] The line treats a document without "by": "hand" as automatic: the fabrication check and everything else that
      applies to automatic fits applies to it. Shotwick's 206 fit goes through that check, and the result (map or
      review queue, with the reason) is recorded in docs/site_flow.md.
- [ ] tests/test_fit_provenance.py: every document in data/db/platefits/ has "by"; the hand ones match the golden list
      plus Maiden Castle; a document without "by" is refused by the line.

## Notes
- Do not change the pairs of any hand fit, and do not touch fit/inkfit.py or the 302 tasks (agent c's job).
