# 305: Ready to fit - the owner clicks the points, the line does everything else
Depends on: 303
Touches: web/index.html, server/serve.py, tools/fit_queue.py, web/data/fit_queue.json, tests/test_fit_queue.py, docs/site_flow.md

## Goal
The owner's hand fits are the only fits that land right (automatic ones: 301, 302b). He likes doing them ("clicking
three points on the diagram and then clicking the points on the map ... certified cool"). So the line becomes:
agents prepare a site all the way to the clicks, the owner places the drawing on the page, and the line takes it to
the map. One site at a time: the page shows him the next site to fit, and when he saves, that site is finished.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] tools/fit_queue.py writes web/data/fit_queue.json: built sites with at least one candidate plan or bird's-eye
      picture (web/data/plans.json, the review items) and no hand fit yet, one entry per site with its best
      candidate first (a true plan over a view, a clear scan over a faint one; the reason in a word), ordered so that
      the sites most worth seeing come first (say how in docs/site_flow.md). Finder/Amazon data never enters it.
- [ ] The page: a "Ready to fit" entry (from the start view) opens the next site in the queue with its best
      candidate already loaded in the existing "Place an old plan" tool; skip moves to the next site. The existing
      tool's clicking is not changed.
- [ ] When the owner saves a fit, server/serve.py runs the one-site line (tools/site_done.py) for that site, so the
      drawing is on the map, the site's square is coloured and its review item is resolved without any other step;
      the saved document carries "by": "hand" (303). The queue moves on to the next site.
- [ ] Checked in a browser the way the owner uses it: open the queue, place a candidate on one site with real clicks,
      save, see it on the map (screenshots in docs/site_flow/). Revert that test fit afterwards: only the owner's
      fits are hand fits. tests/test_fit_queue.py covers the queue and the save -> line step without network.

## Notes
- The page runs on the owner's Mac (server/serve.py --lan, port 8642); keep it stdlib like the rest of serve.py.
- Do not touch fit/inkfit.py, fit/surveyfit.py or the 302/304 tasks (agent c).
