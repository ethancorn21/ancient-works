# 236c: Consolidate the US cities into the page's data and build the sites
Depends on: 236a, 236b, 240, 241
Touches: fit/merge.py, data/catalog/extras.jsonl, data/commons/files.jsonl, data/commons/classified.jsonl, data/merge/, data/sites/, docs/sources.md, web/data/sites.json, web/data/sites/, web/data/plans.json, tests/test_merge.py

## Goal
Subtask of 236. Run the 211 consolidation (fit/merge.py globs every extras_/files_/classified_ staging file)
over 236a's and 236b's staging, build the new sites (aerial ground; 3DEP relief where a fort site has it),
and export plans.json so the new pictures appear on the page and in the fit queue.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] fit/merge.py consolidates the two new staging sets; no duplicate site per QID; the merge test passes.
- [ ] Every new US city site is built (web/data/sites/<id>/ exists, aerial tiles present) and listed in
      web/data/sites.json; plans.json lists their pictures.
- [ ] Every new site ends with a fitted drawing or a review item (tools/site_done.py), as in 212.
- [ ] The page loads with the new sites (server/serve.py), nothing that worked before breaks; full suite =
      baseline.

## Notes
- Site dirs and data/raw are per machine (gitignored): record in the hand-over which sites were built here,
  so the lead syncs them to the owner's Mac.

## Proposed changes
(2026-10-14, iteration 195, agent a - the 236b split, driver instruction.) The bird's-eye staging now
spans THREE source tasks: 236b (16 cities, closed done), 240 (batch 4: Denver, St. Paul, Minneapolis,
Cleveland) and 241 (batch 5: the final five). `Depends on:` now carries 240 and 241 (they must land
before the consolidation). Suggested box changes: (a) box 1's "the two new staging sets" should read
"every staging set under the extras_/files_/classified_ prefixes" - fit/merge.py already globs them
all (verified: its TARGETS pair each canonical file with prefix + "*.jsonl", so 236a's
extras_us_cities, 236b's *_us_birdseye, 240's *_us_birdseye_batch4 and 241's *_us_birdseye_batch5 are
all picked up; the Goal's "over 236a's and 236b's staging" reads the same) - and (b) the 25-city
total that was 236b's box 4 before the split now lives here: add to box 1 (or as a new box) - the
consolidated new US city sites total at least 25 (16 + 4 + 5), or the lead docs record a shortfall
and this task's hand-over records the final count.
