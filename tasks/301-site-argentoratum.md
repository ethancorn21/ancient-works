# 301: Argentoratum (Strasbourg), finished on the map - the second site through the line
Depends on: 300
Touches: web/data/sites.json, web/data/sites/argentoratum-q2361353/, data/review/, docs/site_flow.md, docs/site_flow/, tools/site_done.py, pipeline/plan_fit.py, pipeline/build_site.py

## Goal
One site at a time, all the way to the map (owner, 2026-10-11). Stonehenge went through first and left the line
as one command (docs/site_flow.md). Argentoratum is next: the batch left 8 automatic fit documents for it
(data/db/platefits/argentoratum-q2361353.*.json, best gate 8.7 m). Take it all the way with the line, and look at
the result the way a visitor does before calling it done.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `tools/site_done.py argentoratum-q2361353` run; every picture of the site is synced to the map or an open
      review item, and its entry in web/data/sites.json counts the synced drawings.
- [ ] Checked in a browser: each synced drawing opened over the ground. A drawing that is visibly in the wrong place
      (streets/walls of the drawing not on the real ones) goes to the review queue with the reason, even if its gate
      passed: a gate of 0.0 m means the points were not checked, not that the fit is right. Screenshot of the best
      drawing at docs/site_flow/argentoratum.png with one line on what it shows.
- [ ] Anything that broke in the line on this site is fixed in the line (not by hand for this site), with a test,
      and one line under "What broke" in docs/site_flow.md. The full suite passes.

## Notes
- The 20 hand fits and their golden file stay untouched.
- Do not start 207 or any other task: the lead gives the next site when this one is done.
